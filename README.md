## 🎯 Project Objective

The **SprintShare** project aims to develop a **collaboration management application** that centralizes and streamlines group work for students, addressing the inefficiencies of using multiple disconnected tools.  

This mobile-first platform is designed to make group collaboration **efficient, transparent, and equitable** by integrating key productivity features into one unified system.  

### 🔑 Core Features
- 🗳️ **Proposal Voting System** — Simplifies group decision-making and consensus building.  
- 🕒 **Smart Scheduler** — Suggests optimal meeting times based on member availability.  
- 🎯 **Milestone Tracker** — Tracks progress and manages assigned tasks through visual indicators.  
- 📊 **Contribution Tracker** — Records and displays each member’s input to promote fairness and accountability.  

The system ensures smooth collaboration by reducing **delayed decisions, scheduling conflicts, and lack of accountability**, while being accessible in **mobile platforms**.

> [cite_start] The primary objective of this project is to develop *SprintShare*, a collaboration management application designed to centralize and streamline group collaboration for students [cite: 66, 67].
