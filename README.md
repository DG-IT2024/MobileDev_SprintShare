See source code: https://github.com/DG-IT2024/MobileDev_SprintShare

## Project Objective
[cite_start]The primary objective of this project is to develop **SprintShare** [cite: 66][cite_start], a collaboration management application designed to **centralize and streamline group collaboration** for students[cite: 66, 67].

The system focuses on eliminating the inefficiencies of using scattered tools by integrating:
* [cite_start]A **proposal voting system** to simplify decision-making[cite: 59, 70].
* [cite_start]A **scheduling tool** to suggest the best meeting time based on member availability[cite: 60, 71].
* [cite_start]A **milestone tracker** with task assignments and progress indicators[cite: 61, 72].
* [cite_start]A **contribution tracker** that records and displays each member's input to ensure fairness and accountability[cite: 62, 73].

[cite_start]This platform directly addresses delayed group decisions, scheduling conflicts, and lack of accountability to ensure that group work is more **efficient, transparent, and equitable**[cite: 57, 111]. [cite_start]The platform is required to be available on both **web and mobile devices**.
